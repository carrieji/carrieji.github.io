<br>

I currently work at Cal Poly Pomona and Pasadena City College while pursuing my MBA Degree. I have 9 years of experience in professional office environments including 4 years of direct administrative work. I am familiar with general college/university procedures, policies, and services, and have experience in working with students and handling student inquiries and requests. I would like to work in education fields to serve students.
